# GitHub Actions UI Testing Workflow

This repository contains a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for running UI tests with Playwright.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The workflow is organized into reusable actions and main workflows:

### Actions
- **setup-environment**: Configures Python, installs dependencies, and sets up Playwright with caching
- **run-ui-tests**: Executes UI tests with video recording and detailed logging
- **teams-notification**: Sends rich notifications to Microsoft Teams

### Workflows
- **ui-tests.yml**: Main workflow triggered on push/PR
- **scheduled-ui-tests.yml**: Daily scheduled stability tests

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Teams Webhook (Required)
Add your Microsoft Teams webhook URL as a repository secret:
1. Go to Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add a new secret named `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. Set the value to your Teams webhook URL

### 2. Teams Webhook Setup
To get a Teams webhook URL:
1. Open Microsoft Teams
2. Go to the channel where you want notifications
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Connectors" ‚Üí "Incoming Webhook"
4. Configure the webhook and copy the URL

## üìã Features

### ‚úÖ Environment Setup
- Python 3.11 with pip caching
- Playwright browser caching
- Automatic dependency installation

### ‚úÖ Test Execution
- Video recording of test runs
- Screenshot capture on failures
- Detailed logging
- HTML test reports

### ‚úÖ Artifact Management
- Test videos (7-day retention)
- Screenshots (7-day retention)  
- Logs (14-day retention)
- HTML reports (14-day retention)

### ‚úÖ Teams Notifications
- Rich notifications with test results
- Direct links to build, videos, and logs
- Test statistics (total, passed, failed)
- Color-coded status indicators

## üéØ Usage

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: Runs full test suite
- **Pull Request**: Runs test validation
- **Daily Schedule**: 6 AM UTC stability tests

### Manual Execution
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "UI Tests" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Optionally specify:
   - Custom test file
   - Additional pytest arguments

### Custom Test File
```bash
# Default
pytest tests/ui/registration/test_registration_stability.py

# Custom via workflow dispatch
Test file: tests/ui/login/test_login_stability.py
Pytest args: -v --tb=short -k "test_specific_case"
```

## üìä Outputs

### Artifacts
All test runs generate downloadable artifacts:
- **test-videos-[run-number]**: Video recordings
- **test-screenshots-[run-number]**: Failure screenshots
- **test-logs-[run-number]**: Execution logs
- **test-report-[run-number]**: HTML test report

### Teams Notification
Rich notification includes:
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Status indicator
- Repository and branch information
- Commit SHA and author
- Test statistics
- Direct links to:
  - GitHub Actions build
  - Video artifacts
  - Log files

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Test Files
Edit `.github/workflows/scheduled-ui-tests.yml`:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    test-suite:
      - tests/ui/registration/test_registration_stability.py
      - tests/ui/login/test_login_stability.py        # Add this
      - tests/ui/payment/test_payment_stability.py    # Add this
```

### Modifying Pytest Arguments
Default arguments in `run-ui-tests` action:
```yaml
pytest-args: '-v --tb=short --html=test-results/report.html'
```

### Changing Retention Periods
Modify `retention-days` in workflow files:
```yaml
- name: üìπ Upload test videos
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    retention-days: 14  # Change from 7 to 14 days
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Playwright browsers not installed**
   - Check cache configuration in `setup-environment` action
   - Verify Playwright version consistency

2. **Teams notification failing**
   - Verify `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` secret is set
   - Check webhook URL is valid and active

3. **Video recording not working**
   - Ensure test has `--video=on` option
   - Check video directory permissions

4. **Cache issues**
   - Clear workflow caches in Actions tab
   - Update cache keys if dependencies change

### Debug Mode
Add to workflow for verbose output:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

## üìà Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Dashboard
- View all workflow runs in Actions tab
- Download artifacts directly from run pages
- Monitor execution times and success rates

### Teams Channel
- Real-time notifications for all test runs
- Quick access to build details and artifacts
- Historical record of test executions

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Automated Testing**: Every code change triggers tests
2. **Rich Reporting**: Videos, logs, and HTML reports
3. **Team Visibility**: Teams notifications keep everyone informed
4. **Efficient Caching**: Faster builds with dependency caching
5. **Flexible Execution**: Manual and scheduled runs
6. **Comprehensive Artifacts**: All test outputs preserved and accessible
